# BenchmarkingLazyEvaluation

This repository comprises an article talking about "Eager Evaluation" & "Lazy Evaluation" technique in software development. All C++ source codes of examples in the article can be downloaded from this repository. Several concepts regarding implementing "Lazy Evaluation" are discussed like "Proxy Objects", "Expression Templates" and "Fused Operations".
Also, a performance test has been conducted for Matrix operation (arithmetic). Source code of the benchmarking program can be downloaded from this repository while results are printed in the article.


## Table of Contents
- What is "Eager Evaluation" & "Lazy Evaluation"
- Using "Proxy Objects" to implement "Lazy Evaluation"
- Developing an example C++ code to implementing "Lazy Evaluation" by "Expression Templates"; C++ Template Meta-programming
- Built-in STL "Fused Operations"
- Performance Benchmarking of Eager & Lazy Evaluation in Matrix Arithmetic

## Introduction
The core of the repository is the article in PDF format. All example codes in the article can be downloaded from the repository. The source code of the benchmarking program also can be found in the repository which is a CMake format C++ project.


## Installation
Provided codes can be compiled and executed in command line using MSVC, DPC++ (icpx), LLVM clang++ and GNU g++ compilers both under Windows and Linux. The performance benchmarking program is a CMake project although it can be complied directly too.

## Usage
Please check the PDF file (the article) for details


## Examples
- Implementing Lazy Evaluation through Proxy Objects
- Implementing Lazy Evaluation through Expression Templates
- Benchmarking Lazy Evaluation and Early Evaluation

## Documentation
The technical report is also included in the repository
